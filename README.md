## Other Projects
RiskBazaar is clearly not being developed in a vacuum. There are a multitude of other projects and applications that are currently being built by other teams. Some of these are directly focused on providing insurance solutions whilst others are more generalized and may be integrated to bolster direct insurance applications. Those that are particularly relevant to RiskBazaar are listed below.

__InterChainZ__

This was a project completed by the consultancy Z/Yen Group exploring the uses of mutual distributed ledgers. Among the use cases were an individual seeking to purchase a motor insurance policy with their insurance history stored on a distributed ledger and a small business insurance policy being priced using the data from a corporate credit distributed ledger.

__Tierion__

"Tierion is a simple and powerful way to collect data, record it in the blockchain, and slingshot it to the applications that drive your business. Protect the integrity of your data with the world's most secure and resilient database - the Bitcoin blockchain."

"For each record, a blockchain receipt is generated that contains all the information needed to verify the content and timestamp the record. Generating a blockchain receipt for each survey response makes it possible for anyone to verify the data without relying on a trusted third party. Auditing each result can be done by verifying the receipt. The receipts through verifying all records of time and content, manage to reduce fraud, errors and the costs of auditing claims"
