# The role of the claims adjuster - the major challenge (and opportunity)

Insurance Theory and Practice (Rob Thoyts)

"Claims handling is often described as the acid test of an insurance company. Certainly the policyholder, when judging the quality of a company, will give greater weight to how claims are settled than any other factor. In some cases the availability of an insurance indemnity is all that stands between a policyholder and bankruptcy or insolvency."

"Although an insurance contract is based upon mutual trust, all too often both insurer and policyholder negotiate claims in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion..."

"It is for the party seeking to rely upon a contractual term to prove their case. Therefore as the policyholder is seeking to claim an idemnity based upon the cover offered by the policy, it is for them to prove on the balance of probabilities that the loss occur as stated. They must then establish that the loss that occurred was actually covered by the terms of the policy. They then have to demonstrate the amount of loss in order to claim an indemnity."

"If the insurer wishes to avoid the claim once established, they may seek to claim non-disclosure, breach of warranty or fraud, for example. Alternatively they may argue that a policy exclusion operates. Either way they will be relying on an express or implied term of contract and the burden of proving the applicability of the term lies with them."

"If a policyholder intentionally causes a loss with the intention of claiming an insurance indemnity, that would prima facie constitute fraud."

"An insured loss must be fortuitous. Insurance covers against unexpected and unwelcome events and it is a fundamental assumption of the common pool concept that its members do not wish the loss to occur. This is reinforced by a common clause in all classes of voer that the insurer is not liable if the policyholder fails to take reasonable care. The intent is to reduce moral hazard by requiring the policyholder to act as if they are not insured and facing the financial costs of any loss."

"The courts take the view that one of the risks that a policyholder insures against is their own carelessness and have interpreted 'reasonable precautions' clauses as requiring that the policyholder is reckless rather than negligent before the insurer is entitled to avoid liability."

"The clear message to insurers was that if they wished to exclude certain types of conduct, it was for them to introduce clear policy conditions or warranties spelling this out to the policyholder."

"It is normal practice for insurers to impose conditions concerning the period during which a claim must be notified."

"Fraud - a dishonest intent to gain or cause loss to another facilitated by: i) making a false or misleading representation ii) failing to disclose information when legally obliged to do so iii) abusing a position of trust"

"Some are conceived as entirely fraudulent claims in that the alleged loss did not happen or alternatively the loss was deliberately caused by the policyholder. More commonly, a genuine loss has occurred but the policyholder overstates the amount of damage or claims non-existent property has been lost or stolen. It can even be fraud when the policyholder lies to improve their chances of recovering in respect of a genuine claim. More controversially, there is the question of exaggeration of the amount claimed, where the cause of loss and the description of the items lost or damaged are stated truthfully."

"Merely making a claim for a loss that is not covered is not fraudulent in the absence of any falsehood. There seems no reason why a policyholder should not submit the claim for the insurer to determine.... The burden of proof is on the insurer in such cases."

"The effect of fraud is to disallow the entire claim."

"The right to avoid the claim does not operate retrospectively. Previous claims payments made under the policy cannot be recovered by the insurer. Neither can interim payments made prior to the fraudulent act."

"In Agapitos v Agnew 2002, the court distinguished between 'material fraud' where the claim was false or exaggerated and 'fraudulent devices' where a fair claim was fraudulently embellished (for example, submitting a forged receipt for an item genuinely stolen). Material frauds permit avoidance of the contract from the date of the fraud, but fraudulent devices merely permit avoidance of the claim without cancelling cover for the future."

"In July 2009, the ABI estimated that general insurance fraud costs 1.9 billion GBP equivalent to 6 per cent of the average individual's annual insurance cost. As many as 13 per cent of claims were estimated to be fraudulent."

"In 1994, the Claims & Underwriting Exchange (CUE) was set up by a consortium of insurers. The aim was to maintain a central database of claims information from the member insurers. This woud enable an insurer to check the previous claims history of a proposer but more importantly  enables an insurer to check whether multiple claims are being made in respect of the same incident. One easy way to maximise the benefit of an insurance fraud is to take out cover with a number of companies, invent or stage a loss and then submit a number of fictitious claims."

"It is difficult to argue against the proposition that if an insurer knowingly offers less than a full indemnity, that too is fraud. For example, an insurer who knowingly represents to a policyholder that a particular loss is not covered when they know full well that it is, commits fraud."

"What is far more likely is for economic duress to be used to force a policyholder to accept a settlement offer below a fair indemnity.... By witholding payments an insurer can place the policyholder in such a position that their cash flow is badly interrupted and they may be left with no choice but to accept a low offer as a full and final settlement."
