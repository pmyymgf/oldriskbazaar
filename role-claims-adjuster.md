# The role of the claims adjuster - the major challenge (and opportunity)

Insurance Theory and Practice (Rob Thoyts)

"Claims handling is often described as the acid test of an insurance company. Certainly the policyholder, when judging the quality of a company, will give greater weight to how claims are settled than any other factor. In some cases the availability of an insurance indemnity is all that stands between a policyholder and bankruptcy or insolvency."

"Although an insurance contract is based upon mutual trust, all too often both insurer and policyholder negotiate claims in an atmosphere of mutual suspicion..."

"It is for the party seeking to rely upon a contractual term to prove their case. Therefore as the policyholder is seeking to claim an idemnity based upon the cover offered by the policy, it is for them to prove on the balance of probabilities that the loss occur as stated. They must then establish that the loss that occurred was actually covered by the terms of the policy. They then have to demonstrate the amount of loss in order to claim an indemnity."

"If the insurer wishes to avoid the claim once established, they may seek to claim non-disclosure, breach of warranty or fraud, for example. Alternatively they may argue that a policy exclusion operates. Either way they will be relying on an express or implied term of contract and the burden of proving the applicability of the term lies with them."

"If a policyholder intentionally causes a loss with the intention of claiming an insurance indemnity, that would prima facie constitute fraud."

"An insured loss must be fortuitous. Insurance covers against unexpected and unwelcome events and it is a fundamental assumption of the common pool concept that its members do not wish the loss to occur. This is reinforced by a common clause in all classes of voer that the insurer is not liable if the policyholder fails to take reasonable care. The intent is to reduce moral hazard by requiring the policyholder to act as if they are not insured and facing the financial costs of any loss."

"The courts take the view that one of the risks that a policyholder insures against is their own carelessness and have interpreted 'reasonable precautions' clauses as requiring that the policyholder is reckless rather than negligent before the insurer is entitled to avoid liability."

"The clear message to insurers was that if they wished to exclude certain types of conduct, it was for them to introduce clear policy conditions or warranties spelling this out to the policyholder."

"It is normal practice for insurers to impose conditions concerning the period during which a claim must be notified."

"Fraud - a dishonest intent to gain or cause loss to another facilitated by: i) making a false or misleading representation ii) failing to disclose information when legally obliged to do so iii) abusing a position of trust"
