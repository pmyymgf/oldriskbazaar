"...authenticated and notarized messaging, using a similar approach to the CoinSpark protocol for bitcoin. There are two main uses for messaging. First, it can be used to add important context for an on-blockchain financial transaction, such as a contract, receipt or invoice. Alternatively, it can be used for pure notarized communication with no related movement of funds. In either case, information on the blockchain enables both the sender and the recipient to prove the timing and content of the correspondence that took place."
